Sindr believed his talents as a warrior, tactician, and engineer went largely unappreciated by the Axons, and especially by his father; who always seemed to favor his younger brother. Sindr blamed his mother’s death on the primitive means of the Axons, proclaiming that there are medicines and technologies in Erthe that could have saved her life. He sets out on his journey much to the dismay of his younger brother, who has always looked up to his big brother. "

The unit of men marched on through the night without stopping."
